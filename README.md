Please note the original source of `django-bootstrap3-datetimepicker/bootstrap3_datetime/widgets.py` was changed at some point during development to resolve an open issue link: https://github.com/nkunihiko/django-bootstrap3-datetimepicker/issues/33. Any clones of these repo that are made while the issue remains unresolved will require one to follow the instructions found in the provided link. 

Otherwise, to make a local deploy...

1. Clone repo.
2. Create a virtual environment using either conda's `conda create` or virtualenv's `mkvirtualenv` commands.
3. Install dependencies into your created virtual environment from the `requirements.txt` file.
4. `cd` into the cloned repo if you haven't already and launch teh django app using `python manage.py runserver`.
5. Open a web browser and type `localhost:8000`.

Et voila!
